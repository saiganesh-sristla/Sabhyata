# Seat Lock Release Fix - Summary

## Problem
Locked seats were not being released to "available" status after 5 minutes when payment was not completed. The seats remained locked indefinitely.

## Root Cause
The `cleanupExpiredSeatLocks()` function was **called but never defined** in `tempBookingController.js` (line 242). This meant the cleanup job running every 30 seconds was failing silently.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Missing Function (Backend)
**File**: `Backend/controllers/tempBookingController.js`

Added the missing `cleanupExpiredSeatLocks()` function that:
- Calls `ShowSeatLayout.cleanupAllExpiredLocks(5)` to release all expired locks across all show layouts
- Uses a 5-minute timeout to match the booking expiry time
- Provides detailed logging for debugging

### 2. Enhanced Logging (Backend)
**File**: `Backend/models/ShowSeatLayout.js`

Improved logging in:
- `releaseExpired()` method - now shows before/after counts of locked seats
- `cleanupAllExpiredLocks()` static method - shows detailed progress of cleanup operation

### 3. Existing Mechanisms (Already Working)

The following were already in place and working correctly:

1. **Server Cleanup Job** (`Backend/server.js` line 119):
   - Runs `cleanupExpiredBookings()` every 30 seconds
   - Now properly calls the seat lock cleanup function

2. **Frontend Auto-Refresh** (`Frontend/src/pages/UserSeatMap.tsx` lines 313-344):
   - Refreshes seat layout every 30 seconds
   - Updates UI when seats change from locked to available

3. **On-Demand Release** (`Backend/controllers/admin/seatLayoutController.js` line 195):
   - Calls `showLayout.releaseExpired()` when seat layout is fetched
   - Ensures expired locks are released immediately when users view seats

## How It Works Now

### When a user locks seats:
1. User selects seats â†’ seats marked as "locked" with `lockedAt` timestamp
2. Temp booking created with 5-minute expiry

### If payment NOT completed within 5 minutes:
1. **Server cleanup job** (every 30 seconds):
   - Finds all pending bookings with `expiresAt < now`
   - Releases seats using `unlockSeats()` method
   - Calls `cleanupExpiredSeatLocks()` to catch any missed locks
   
2. **ShowSeatLayout cleanup**:
   - Finds all layouts with locked seats
   - Checks if `lockedAt` timestamp is older than 5 minutes
   - Updates seat status from "locked" to "available"
   - Updates counters (available_seats, booked_seats)

3. **Frontend auto-refresh**:
   - Fetches updated seat layout every 30 seconds
   - Detects changes and updates UI
   - Users see seats become available again

### If payment IS completed:
1. Seats status changed from "locked" to "booked"
2. Booking status changed from "pending" to "confirmed"
3. Tickets generated and booking finalized

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Added missing `cleanupExpiredSeatLocks()` function
- [x] Enhanced logging for debugging
- [x] Verified cleanup job runs every 30 seconds
- [x] Verified `releaseExpired()` is called on seat layout fetch
- [x] Frontend auto-refresh working (30 seconds)

## Files Modified

1. `Backend/controllers/tempBookingController.js`
   - Added `cleanupExpiredSeatLocks()` function (lines 225-241)

2. `Backend/models/ShowSeatLayout.js`
   - Enhanced `releaseExpired()` method with better logging (lines 169-212)
   - Enhanced `cleanupAllExpiredLocks()` static method (lines 215-257)

## Expected Behavior

1. **User locks seats** â†’ Seats show as locked (gray) for other users
2. **User abandons payment** â†’ After 5 minutes, seats automatically become available
3. **Other users see update** â†’ Within 30 seconds via auto-refresh
4. **User completes payment** â†’ Seats permanently marked as booked

## Monitoring

Check server logs for:
- `ðŸ§¹ Starting cleanup of expired bookings...` (every 30 seconds)
- `ðŸ§¹ Starting global cleanup of expired seat locks...` (every 30 seconds)
- `âœ… Released X expired locks in layout Y` (when locks are released)
- `ðŸ”„ Auto-refreshing seat layout...` (frontend, every 30 seconds)

## Notes

- Cleanup runs every **30 seconds** (not 5 minutes) for better responsiveness
- Lock timeout is **5 minutes** to match booking expiry
- Frontend refresh is **30 seconds** to balance UX and server load
- All three mechanisms work together for redundancy
